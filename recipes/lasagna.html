        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>It was very good and is great for leftovers too.
            I did make a key change:
            I used a homemade sauce instead of a 
            jarred sauce. The homemade sauce already had
            onion and garlic so I left those out of 
            the main recipe. I enjoyed the cheddar cheese 
            in this recipe, my mother had always used 
            only mozzarella. I recommend this recipe 
            and I look forward to having it again 
            (with my own sauce recipe). Oh add some shredded
            parmessan after you take it from the oven!
        </p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li> 1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
                <li> 1 pound lean ground beef</li>
                <li> salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li> 1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
                <li> 1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li> ½ pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li> ½ pound shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li> 1 pint ricotta cheese</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly
                    salted water to a boil.
                    Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes
                    or until al dente; drain.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                    In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown beef 
                    and season with salt and pepper; drain. Stir in 
                    spaghetti sauce and garlic and simmer 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, combine mozzarella, 
                    Cheddar and ricotta; stir well. In 9x13 inch pan,
                    alternate layers of noodles, meat 
                    mixture and cheese mixture until pan is filled.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes,
                    or until cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            </ol>
